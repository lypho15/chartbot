# Task
Create a new nursing-related educational chatbot.

## Define the new chatbot's purpose and scope

### Subtask:
Determine the specific educational focus and target audience for this new chatbot.

**Reasoning**:
Define the educational focus, scope, and learning outcomes based on the target audience.
"""

educational_focus = """
The educational focus of this chatbot is to provide a supportive and interactive learning environment for Beginner to Intermediate Nursing Students. It will cover foundational nursing concepts and common clinical scenarios to reinforce theoretical knowledge and develop critical thinking skills.
"""

scope = """
The scope of the chatbot will include, but not be limited to:
- Basic anatomy and physiology relevant to common conditions.
- Fundamental nursing skills (e.g., vital signs, medication administration basics, wound care basics).
- Understanding of common diseases and conditions encountered in entry-level clinical rotations (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, basic respiratory issues).
- Principles of patient safety and infection control.
- Introduction to ethical and legal considerations in nursing practice.
- Case studies simulating common clinical scenarios for assessment and intervention practice.
"""

learning_outcomes = """
Upon interacting with the chatbot, users should be able to:
- Explain foundational concepts in anatomy, physiology, and common disease processes.
- Describe the steps for performing basic nursing skills.
- Identify potential nursing diagnoses and appropriate interventions for common clinical scenarios.
- Apply principles of patient safety and infection control in simulated situations.
- Recognize basic ethical and legal considerations in nursing.
- Enhance critical thinking skills through the analysis of clinical case studies.

Implement a basic chatbot structure using a simple rule-based approach with functions to handle different user inputs and interactions, covering the initial greeting, handling topic questions, and providing basic help and exit functionality. This addresses steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 of the instructions by choosing an approach, implementing initial logic, handling specific input types (topic questions as an example), providing information, adding help/navigation, and allowing exit.

I choose PythonAnywhere as the deployment platform for this nursing educational chatbot.

Justification:
1. Ease of Use: PythonAnywhere is specifically designed for hosting Python web applications and offers a very user-friendly interface, making it easy to deploy and manage the chatbot even with limited web development experience.
2. Free Tier: It provides a free tier which is sufficient for getting started and handling potentially low initial traffic from beginner to intermediate nursing students. This keeps costs down during the development and initial testing phases.
3. Suitability for Simple Applications: The current chatbot implementation is a simple rule-based Python script. PythonAnywhere is well-suited for hosting such applications without requiring complex configurations.
4. Focus on Python: Being a Python-focused platform simplifies the deployment process as it is tailored to the language the chatbot is written in.

While platforms like Heroku and GCP also have free tiers and good features, PythonAnywhere's emphasis on ease of use for Python applications makes it the most appropriate choice for this project's current stage and target audience. AWS Lambda is a good serverless option but might require more significant code refactoring to fit a serverless architecture compared to PythonAnywhere's traditional web application hosting.
